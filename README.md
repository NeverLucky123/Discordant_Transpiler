# Discordant_Transpiler
The Transpiler for Discordant, a language that compiles to c++, 
currently being written in Python, though I might move it later
## Features Being Considered
1.  if/while/for... statements by indentation instead of curly brackets(done)
2.  limited dynamic typing(done)
3.  list comprehensions(done)
4.  better syntax for vectors and stdlib arrays(currently implementing)
5.  function declaration by indentation(done)
6.  revamped include system with automatically generated header files(really not sure)
    *requires Lzz, which is bootstrapped in a whack way and is also written with platform-specific code
7.  implicit multithreading(this is never going to happen)
8.  an **when** statement;multithreaded arbitrary state listener(yeah, no idea either: little more likely)
9.  pythonic array slicing(probably okay)
10. compile dependency tree
